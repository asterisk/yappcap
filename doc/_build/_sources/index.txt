Welcome to yappcap's documentation!
***********************************

yappcap is a Python wrapper around `libpcap
<http://www.tcpdump.org/pcap.html>`_. There are many pcap libraries for Python,
but none are full-featured, actively maintained, and well-documented. yappcap
aims to rectify this situation.
